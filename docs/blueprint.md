# **App Name**: RivalXP

## Core Features:

- AI Rival Personalization & Taunts: Users customize their AI Rival's appearance (sprite) and choose a personality tone. The AI acts as a tool, generating light, contextual taunts throughout the day, dynamically responding to user activity (or inactivity) based on the chosen personality.
- Task Creation & Management: Users define and manage daily quests with titles, duration/completion types, and XP rewards, limited to timed and binary tasks as MVP constraint.
- Real-Time XP Race Dashboard: A dashboard prominently displaying user and rival XP in real-time. Includes customizable pixel art sprites with animations for XP bursts on task completion and visual progression for the rival during user inactivity.
- Focus Mode Mechanic: Users can activate a 'Focus Mode' during active work sessions, which pauses or significantly slows the rival's XP accumulation, providing control and mitigating hopelessness.
- Daily Cycle & Summary: Manages the daily XP race, ensuring it concludes at 11:59 PM, and presents an end-of-day summary with winner animations and performance statistics.
- Progress Persistence: Securely stores all user data, including rival customizations, created tasks, daily progress, and overall XP accumulation to maintain game state across sessions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant, energetic red-orange (#E64D1A) to signify active participation and a competitive edge, inspired by classic pixel RPG intensity and the 'Red' in Pokémon Red and Blue.
- Background color: A subtly warm, very light beige (#F5F1F0) to maintain a bright, active canvas reminiscent of early console RPGs, ensuring legibility and focus without distraction.
- Accent color: An active and clear magenta-pink (#E46787) for highlighting achievements, notifications, and interactive elements, chosen for its strong contrast and stimulating visual appeal, analogous to the primary color.
- Headlines will use 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) to convey a modern, techy, and slightly retro-gaming feel, suitable for prominent titles and impactful statements.
- Body text will use 'Inter' (sans-serif) for optimal readability and a neutral, objective aesthetic, ensuring task descriptions and rival taunts are clear and accessible.
- All UI icons and character visuals will be rendered in a consistent pixel-art style, evoking nostalgia for classic 8-bit/16-bit RPGs, similar to the provided Pokemon sprites.
- A minimal, clean UI focused on clear progress bars for XP, with sprite-based characters taking center stage. Important information is readily accessible to emphasize the real-time competitive aspect.
- Subtle yet engaging pixel animations for task completion celebrations, XP bursts, rival level-ups, and end-of-day summaries, to enhance gamification and provide immediate visual feedback.
